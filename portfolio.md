Do you have land that you're currently not using and would like to make some extra money? Create a Landowner user account through RVbnb and post a listing of your land on the app so that RV owners can make a reservation and use your land.

Or if you're a RV owner, have you ever found RV parks over crowded or unavailable during your trip? Create a RV Owner user account through RVbnb and gain access to privately owned land that would have been previously unavailable to you.

RVbnb is a great app that connects landowners and RV owners together.
