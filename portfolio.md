### [RVbnb(Android)](https://github.com/RVbnb/rvbnb_android)

Do you have land that you're currently not using and would like to make some extra money? Create a Landowner user account through RVbnb and post a listing of your land on the app so that RV owners can make a reservation and use your land.

Or if you're a RV owner, have you ever found RV parks over crowded or unavailable during your trip? Create a RV Owner user account through RVbnb and gain access to privately owned land that would have been previously unavailable to you.

RVbnb is a great app that connects landowners and RV owners together.

### [Foodie App(Android)](https://github.com/build-week-foodie-fun/Android)

Foodie App was created by a three person Android team within four days.

Ever hate remembering what you have and haven't ordered at a restaurant and what you liked and didn't like? Well Foodie App can help with that!

Foodie App allows users to document information about the food they have eaten. Users are able to create new food entries with the following information: such as the name of the restaurant, the restaurant type, what they ordered, the date they ate there, the price, how they rate it, attach an image and make any other comments. Those created entries can then be accessed to update with either new information or deleted from the list.
