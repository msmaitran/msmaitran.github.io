# Mai Tran

A woman breaking into tech and looking for my first engineering role. Recently completed LambdaSchool's Android Development bootcamp program. Made a career switch from accounting after 7+ years because I love solving problems. Previous experience as Accounting Manager demonstrates detail-oriented, effective communication and management skills. Super excited for the new journey!

Volunteering as Media Evangelist for Women Who Code San Francisco because I believe in their mission and vision. I want to be a part of promoting diversity, as well as inspiring and empowering women in the tech world.

During my free time, I enjoy spending it outdoors. I would like to visit all of the National Parks.
