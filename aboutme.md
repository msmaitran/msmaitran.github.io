# Mai Tran

Android Developer with a specialty in Kotlin. Previous experience as Accounting Manager demonstrates detail-oriented, effective communication and management skills. After 7+ years, I decided to make a career change. Super excited for the new journey!

During my free time, I enjoy spending it outdoors. I would like to visit all of the National Parks.
